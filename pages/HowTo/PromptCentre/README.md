To create an output template and see the results, follow these steps:

1. **Create a DataSet**:
   - Go to the [Datasets Interface](http://34.244.159.150:8000/api/datasets/).

   - Create a new template. Insert placeholders in the format `<placeholder_name>` where you want data from your dataset to appear.

3. **Test Your Template**:
   - Visit the [Test Template Interface](http://34.244.159.150:8000/modular-scripts/test/).
   - Select the template and dataset you created.
   - Submit and view the processed output.

4. **Review and Edit as Needed**:
   - If the output isn't what you expected, go back and edit your dataset or template.
   - Use the Admin Panel for more detailed edits or to troubleshoot.

Congratulations! You've now learned how to create and test output templates with your data. Explore the interfaces and experiment with different datasets and templates to see what you can create!
